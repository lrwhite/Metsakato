            <h1><u><b><i>The Benefits of Trees</b></i></u></h1>
        <h2 class="sub-title">What do trees do for us?</h2>
        <li>Trees absorb greenhouse gasses that fuel global warming. The forests of the Earth start our food chain because smaller animals eat off the trees fruit and the predators eat those animals thus, the food chain begins.</li><br>
        <li class="example">The biggest resource humans and animals get from trees is oxygen. Trees absorb the carbon dioxide in our air, turn it into oxygen, and then release it back into the atmosphere.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Trees reduce the level of fear and violence. Neighborhoods and homes that are barren have shown to have a greater incidence of violence in and out of the home rather than their neighborhoods rich in green vegetation.</li>
            <br>
        <li class="example">Trees are needed to keep us alive, they produce the essentials to sustain life and they protect us by enhancing the atmosphere. Trees also provide resources to humans such as wood for construction, and they also provide paper for schools and busineses. We are destroying the grounds to re plant trees in and we are doing that by using fossil fuels. Therefore, we must saave the trees and switch to solar energy and clean energy.</li>

                <th rowspan="2">Effects
                        <p class="example"><li>Loss of species: Animals and plants live in forests lose their habitats due to deforestation. </p></li>
        <p class="example"><li>Water cycle: Trees are important to the water cycle. They absorb rainfall and produce water vapor that is released into the atmosphere. Trees also lessen the pollution in water</p></li>
<p class="example"><li>Life quality: Soil erosion can also lead to silt entering the lakes, streams and other water sources. This can decrease local water quality and contribute to poor health in populations in the area.</li>
</p></th>

                <th rowspan="2">Solutions
                        <p class="example"><li>Promoting sustainable choices, by using less stuff, eating sustainable food, and choosing recycled or certified sustainable wood products, we can all be part of the movement towards zero deforestation. </p></li>
        <p class="example"><li>Clear cutting forests must be banned. Also when a tree is cut down it must be replanted with a new tree</p></li>
            <p class="example"><li>Recycling and going green</p></th></li>
